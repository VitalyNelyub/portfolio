        My name is Vitaliy and I am excited to introduce myself as a Junior
        Front-end developer. I have strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        React, Node.js which I have got through my practical experience as well
        as my education. My passion for web development has driven me to
        continuous learning and improving my skills, and I am always eager to
        take on new challenges. In addition to my technical skills, I am an
        quick learner and a great communicator. I am good at working in a team
        and am always willing to give a helping hand whenever it is needed. I
        work well under pressure and can manage challenging tasks. I am
        confident that I would be able to learn from your experienced team
        members, as well as contribute my own ideas and expertise. I am excited
        to continue growing as a developer and look forward to the opportunity
        to do so with your team.
